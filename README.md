# My Personal Project

## Trivia Game  

The main components of my game can be broken down into these 2 main parts:

*To-do List*:
- Game Class
- List of Game Class

So for my game I was thinking of creating an application in the style of a 
trivia game against a computer (random, not ai). The main idea of the project would be answering
trivia questions against a computer. If for example, you answered correctly
and the computer was wrong the computer would then lose a life. After finishing
a game, the questions, answers, accuracy and maybe time spent on each question would 
be recorded in a list containing all past games.

This application can hopefully be used by anyone who wants
to answer some trivia questions in a different context. I
wanted to create this project because it combines two things
I enjoy. I like trivia and testing your knowledge on various
subjects. I also love playing games so I decided to create a
trivia game application with popular gaming aspects like lives, 
a timer and maybe more game concepts for the visual aspect of
the project.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to start a trivia game and add it to a list of games played
- As a user, I want to be able to view my past games
- As a user, I want to be able to see my question accuracy
- As a user, I want to be able to see my stats across all games
- As a user, I want to be able to see how many games I have played in total
- As a user, I would like to save my game history and be prompted to save when I exit the game.
- As a user, I would like to load my past game history.

# Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the second required action related to adding Xs to a Y by viewing past games to see
- You can locate my visual component by starting the game
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the save button
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the load button

Phase 4: Task 3

Firstly, I would like to just clean up all my code. 
While working through the different phases, 
I continually added new code to the bottom and now stepping 
back and looking at the finished product made me realize
how unreadable my code truly is. When trying to fix specific mistakes
in past code I found it very difficult to find those methods quickly.
Especially, when working with the gui the code started to get messy.
Straight away, I could try to separate the different gui components
into different classes like in the alarm system example to increase cohesion.
I thought about implementing the design patterns we learned
in class, but overall I feel the structure of my code is 
quite simple and the design patterns would not help in this scenario.
