# My Personal Project

## Trivia Game  

The main components of my game can be broken down into these 2 main parts:

*To-do List*:
- Game Class
- List of Game Class

So for my game I was thinking of creating an application in the style of a 
trivia game against a computer (random, not ai). The main idea of the project would be answering
trivia questions against a computer. If for example, you answered correctly
and the computer was wrong the computer would then lose a life. After finishing
a game, the questions, answers, accuracy and maybe time spent on each question would 
be recorded in a list containing all past games.

This application can hopefully be used by anyone who wants
to answer some trivia questions in a different context. I
wanted to create this project because it combines two things
I enjoy. I like trivia and testing your knowledge on various
subjects. I also love playing games so I decided to create a
trivia game application with popular gaming aspects like lives, 
a timer and maybe more game concepts for the visual aspect of
the project.
